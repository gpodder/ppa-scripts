As of gPodder 3.6, alpha support for syncing directly to iPod devices
has been restored.  (This was available in gPodder 2.x, but has not
been present in the 3.x version until this release.)

Users may be interested in the gpodder-migrate2tres command which will
migrate gPodder 2.x configurations to the format used by gPodder 3.x.
This binary is included in the gpodder_3.x packages.  Similarly, users
can generate a backup of their existing 2.x configurations by using
the gpodder-backup script (currently shipped in the gpodder_2.x packages).

Thank you for using gPodder!
